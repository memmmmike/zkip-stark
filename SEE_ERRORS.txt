To fix the build, I need to see the actual error messages.

Please run this command from the project root directory:

lake build 2>&1 | head -100

Or if that doesn't work, try:

lake build ZkIpProtocol 2>&1

The error messages will tell us exactly what's wrong:
- Type mismatches
- Missing imports
- Unknown identifiers
- Toolchain issues
- etc.

Once I see the errors, I can fix them permanently.
