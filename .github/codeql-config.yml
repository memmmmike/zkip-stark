# CodeQL configuration for ZK-IP Protocol
# Note: CodeQL doesn't officially support Lean 4 yet
# This configuration is prepared for when support is added

name: "ZK-IP Protocol CodeQL"

# Currently, CodeQL supports: cpp, csharp, go, java, javascript, python, ruby
# Lean 4 support is not available yet, but we can prepare queries for:
# - C code generated by Lean 4 compiler
# - Rust code (if we add Rust components for NoCap FFI)

# When Lean 4 support is added, uncomment:
# languages:
#   - lean

# For now, we can analyze C code generated by Lean:
# languages:
#   - cpp

# Query suites to run
queries:
  # Security queries
  - uses: security-extended
  # Custom queries for ZK-IP Protocol
  - uses: ./.github/codeql-queries

# Paths to exclude
paths-ignore:
  - '.lake/**'
  - '.github/**'
  - '**/*.olean'
  - '**/*.ilean'
